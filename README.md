# game_stats_project
An application using databases by Pontus Lindvall and Emil Halvarsson

To initialize the database the user need to start MySQL workbench and open the file
"schema.sql". The user is expected to run this file and refresh the databases. The
user should now be able to see the database in the navigator as "gamestatsdb".
If the user wants to add some initial data to the database, open and run the
"sample_data.sql" file. The database is now initialized.

To run the application the user needs to establish a connection to the database.
This can be done in the "main.py" file near the top. All you need to do is type
in your password to MySQL workbench. Then you can run the python file and the 
appication will start.

You are now ready to use the application! :D
